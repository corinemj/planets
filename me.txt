Hello, I am Corine Jackman. I was born in Mineola, NY and went to Amityville High School. I spent time practicing the piano, playing the flute and running track. Then I got a
 scholarship to Howard University for a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. I made a lot of friends. I made more friends at the University of Michigan. At the U of M, I am still
 studying chemical engineering. I really like my advisor, and I am having a wonderful experience here. Michigan is very beautiful, especially in the Summer, and I look forward 
to the next couple of years here. My family is very supportive and they will always be an important part of my life.
